Full mechanization in Coq of:
- The computational adequacy for a call-by-value typed language with subtyping.
- The compiler correctness to an abstract machine for a call-by-need typed
  language.

Interesting aspects:
* The first mechanization of Reynolds' bracketing theorem and also the
  use of biorthogonality with extrinsic semantics instead of intrinsic
  semantics.

* In general, the extension of the domain library with the domains
  needed to give denotational semantics to the different languages,
  adding for instance, products and coproducts.
