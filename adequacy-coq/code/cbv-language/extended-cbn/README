Compile the domain theory library first using the Makefile inside
./domain-theory/ folder. Then compile this folder using ./Makefile.

In Emacs use ProofGeneral 4.3 to automatically adjust the loadpath
accordingly to the file ./_CoqProject (not available in ProofGeneral
4.2) or just set the loadpath in the old way using environment
variables as described in ProofGeneral documentation.

The domain theory library was written by Benton et.al [1], we updated
the code for the last stable version of Coq available at the moment
(8.4pl5). Our extensions for the library are in the files PredomMore,
PredomNary, and CCC.v
